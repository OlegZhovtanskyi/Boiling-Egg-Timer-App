# Boiling-Egg-Timer-App
This is a simple iOS app created with Swift and Storyboard that helps you choose from 3 different types of boiled eggs and start a timer.

The app allows you to select the type of boiled egg you want, whether it's soft, medium, or hard-boiled, and then start a timer to cook the egg for the desired amount of time.
